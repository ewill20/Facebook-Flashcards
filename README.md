#defriendr

We all have had our share of people add us on Facebook as a friend only to later think, "Do I know this person."  Maybe you were on a trip and met someone, friended them on Facebook, then later realized you didn't want them as a friend.  Our app is here to help you unfortuante souls that end up with a bloated friends list.

Via our flashcard interface one can either choose to add a friend to the "defriend" or "block" list or they can attempt to enter information correlating with that friend's information in order to gain "points."  The defriend and block lists can be shared via Facebook's timeline and used to clean up one's friends list.  The points system will allow one to view how well they may know some of their friends.

defriendr is a quick and easy way to trim your friends list and ensure that only people you know or care about are indeed your friends.  Happy defriending!
